My name is Linh, I am a web developer from Ha Noi, Viet Nam. My hobby is playing football, table tennis and Doto :D. 

I spend free time on this blog talking about Linux, Python, Golang and something in my life. This is how I review my knowledge, learn something new and make new friends.

I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build a modern static website. You can find a tutorial on [here](https://imlinh.com)
